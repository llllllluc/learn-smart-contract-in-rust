# Overview

In this repo, I plan to go over some popular smart contract programming environments that is production ready in rust. As of 2022, other than EVM, majority of smart contract platforms use Wasm based VM, with a few using other less common VM. But almost all of them use rust as the major programming language, due to its well support for Wasm and low level programming. 

Although most are based on Wasm, but they are still pretty different, even among different CosmWasm based chains, it's not guaranteed program will be compatible due to chain environment and version. I also aim to understand what does the difference look like in detail here.
